	Probabilistic circuits (PCs) have gained prominence in recent years as a versatile framework for discussing probabilistic models that support tractable queries and are yet expressive enough to model complex probability distributions.
	Nevertheless, tractability comes at a cost: PCs are less expressive than neural networks.
	In this extended abstract we briefly summarize the concept of a probabilistic neural circuit (PNC), which strikes a balance between PCs and neural nets in terms of tractability and expressive power, and distinguishes itself from ordinary PCs by the presence of autoregressive connections.

\section{Introduction}

In recent years probabilistic circuits (PCs) (also called sum-product networks)~\citep{darwiche2003differential} have emerged as an assembly language to talk about tractable probabilistic models and inference therein~\citep{vergari2021compositional}. The core idea is quite simple: we start with a set of independent random variables and construct complex probability distribution by recursively adding and multiplying them together.
There are two common ways of interpreting PCs. Firstly, we can consider them to be hierarchical mixture models. Secondly, we look at them as neural nets consisting of sums, products, and atomic probability distributions.

A major advantage of PCs is their ability to answer certain queries in polynomial time -- given that adequate restrictions are imposed on a circuit's structure~\citep{vergari2021compositional}. An example of such a tractable query would be the computation of conditional probabilities for so-called \textit{smooth and decomposable} PCs~\citep{darwiche2001decomposable,darwiche2003differential}.
This tractability, however, comes at a hefty price: the properties imposed on PCs in order to ensure polynomial time queries limit their expressive power~\citep{martens2014expressive,sharir2018sum}.
In this extended abstract we give a short exposition of the ideas presented in~\citep{zuidberg2024probabilistic} where we used the concepts of \textit{conditional smoothness} and \textit{conditional decomposability}~\citep{sharir2018sum}
to develop probabilistic neural circuits -- a novel probabilistic model class that trades-off tractability and expressive power.








\section{Layered Probabilistic Neural Circuits}

The key difference between (layered) probabilistic circuits ~\citep{peharz2020einsum} and probabilistic neural circuits is the presence of Ã¡utoregressive connections in the circuit. We illustrate this in Figure~\ref{fig:partition_graph}. It is precisely these autoregressive connections that lead to a huge boost in expressive power. We show this in our experimental study in~\citep{zuidberg2024probabilistic}. Note that this gain in expressive power comes at the cost of tractability: not all marginals of the joint distributions are computable in poly-time anymore.

		On the left we have probabilistic neural circuit. The par tof the circuit that is drawn in black indicates the structure of an ordinary probabilistic circuit.
		The red structure indicates the (neural) autoregressive connection that Separates a PNCs from these ordinary PCs.
		On the right we give a more detailed graphical representation of neural dependencies in a PNC. The sum unit at the top outputs the weighted sum of the three product units at the bottom right. The weights for the sum are the outputs of a neural network for which it holds that $\sum_{i=1}^3=1$.
